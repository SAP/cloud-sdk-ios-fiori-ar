# AR Cards

The AR Cards use case is essentially annotations represented by a marker in the real world that correspond to data displayed in a card. There is a one to one mapping of markers to cards. After creation of a scene in reality composer and the data that's associated with those positions, they can be loaded into the content view. Supports Image and Object anchors.
